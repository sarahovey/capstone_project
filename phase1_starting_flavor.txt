The sun gently shines through the curtains, waking you up.
Your human is already gone for the day. You know they'll be back later, but you still wish they wouldn't leave.
Your friend the cat is home, but he's never awake during the day when you want to play!
You decide to venture out on your own to find your human! Never separated again!
What are you going to do today?
